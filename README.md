# Features

* **Organize your doujin collection**
  * Include all your doujins in one app without having them clutter your gallery app! Use the search and bookmark functions to organize your ever increasing doujins.

* **Automatic tag retrieval** 
  * Tsuki Viewer fetches english title, japanese title and tags from [NHentai](https://nhentai.net) based on the name of your directory.
  
* **Customize tags freely** 
  * Built-in editor to let you append or remove tags fetched from [NHentai](https://nhentai.net). You can also add your own tags on non-doujin directories.
  
* **Supports third party image-viewers** 
  * You can either use the built-in image viewer or open another gallery such as ```QuickPic``` to read your doujins.
  
* **More storage space for your phone** 
  * If you have a lot of images, most galleries build up thumbnail database which can quickly escalate to multiple GBs. If you open images from Tsuki Viewer, the native gallery       app won't generate a lot of thumbnails. That means more precious storage for your phone.
